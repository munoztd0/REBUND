## Description

<p>This repository contains the code for running the REBUND experiment in JavaScript with an integration with Pavlovia ("html" folder). Data are saved to the "data" folder.</p>

<p>The experiment was created using lab.js (https://lab.js.org) and can be open and modified from this platform by using the .json file ("REBUND_v1.json").</p>

<p>Note that the final completion code is specific to the Prolific.co study created and maintained by the Laboratory for the Study of Emotion Elicitation and Expression (E3Lab). This code is not strictly necessary to run the study and should be removed if the code is reused to another purpose.</p>
